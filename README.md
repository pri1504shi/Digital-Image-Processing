# Digital-Image-Processing
Mapping Urban Green Regions
In this project, we have explored the usage of digital image processing techniques to calculate the green area in a given satellite image. Using Jupyter Lab and Python, we have completed the process. First, we identified the red border, and with the help of the OpenCV  library, we identified the contour, applied red mask followed by the green mask, and calculated green pixels within the red border.
